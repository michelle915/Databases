        <h2>Website Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            Last year, Loya Fencing invoiced $2.5 million in fence sales. Loya Fencing focuses on discovering clients, selling fences, and customer satisfaction. 
            Once a customer pays the deposit for a fence, Loya Fencing will assign the construction of the fence to one of the many construction contractors that 
            they partner with. The company needs a means to keep track of sales data as it continues growing. This data would serve a variety of purposes, including 
            calculating earnings, taxes, and general business intelligence. Additionally, a database would provide a far more robust structure rather than using paper 
            (an improvement in record keeping) and provide improved accessibility. A database-driven website will record Invoices of Fences sold by Loya Fencingâ€™s team 
            of Salesmen to their Customers. The database will also track the Contractors assigned by Loya Fencing to construct/install the purchased fences.
